<h1>What is ‘void’ in a method declaration?</h1>
<br/>
<p>
What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a <br/>
method with a return type?<br/>
</p>
Void in a a method declaration lets the compiler know that there will be nothing<br/>
returned back to the line of code that called the method. <br/>
When you declare a method with a return type the compiler will know what the <br/>
type should be and to check for that result type prior to returning that value to <br/>
the calling line of code.<br/>
Here are two examples of a method declarations with void and a return type:<br/>
<div>
  public void printThis()   <br/>
  { <br/>
     System.out.println("Printing this!");  <br/>
  }  <br/>
  public double getPrice()  <br/>
  {  <br/>
    return price;  <br/>
  }  <br/>
</div>
</body>
