<h1>difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”</h1> <br/>
<p>
When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an <br/>
“argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other? <br/>
</p>
<br/>
  <p>
    The difference is that a an argument in respect to methods is the actual <br/>
    value that is passed to the method (as input) when it is called. <br/>
    Parameter refers to the variables that are used in the function declaration/definition <br/>
    to represent those arguments that were send to the function during the function call. <br/>
    So, you would use arguments to pass values to a method that you would call. <br/>
    While parameters would be the declaration in the definition of the method to <br/>
    hold those inputs as variables.
