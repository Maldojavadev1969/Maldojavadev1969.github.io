<h1>'switch’ and ‘if/else’</h1>
<br/>

  <p>Here  is the basic template for the if/else control structure:

  if((boolean expression))
  {                         //comment- curly braces optional if one statement!
    statements
  }
  else if{boolean expressions}
  {
    statements
  }
  else(boolean expression)
  {
    statements
  }


    An if/else uses the if(this condition is true) then execute the statements
  along with skipping all the other if/else statements.
  If the boolean expression is false then fall to the next else if condition
  until one of the conditions evaluates to true or none of them are true and none
  of the statements are executed!

  We can also have nested if else statements inside and if statement as follows:
  if(boolean expression)
  {
    if(boolean expression)
    {
      statements
    }
    else
      statements
  }

  Now the switch control (case) structure has the following basic
  template:

  switch(switchExpression)
  {
    case 1:
      statements
      break;
    case 2:
      statements
      break;
    default:
      statements
      break;
  }

  One advantage of the switch statement is that it has the ability to execute more
  than one alternative statement by omitting break statements and this is not
  possible in if-else-if statement!

  I would use a switch statement to make a decision based on the value of a
  single variable/expression but use a if/else condition for testing different
  variables and expressions.</p>
