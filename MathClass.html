<h1>‘Math.random()’</h1>
<br/>

  <p>
To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the<br/>
return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized<br/>


Math is a Java class that has dozens of math methods that can be utilized such as <br/>
Math.random() method. The return type of .random is a random floating <br/>
point number between 0 and 1. <br/>
The reason that the 'M' in Math is capitalized is to distinguish class names<br/>
from member names.<br/>
The random method is found in the following package: java.lang.Math.
