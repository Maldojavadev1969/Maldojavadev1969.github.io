<h1>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’</h1>
<br/>
  <p>The '=' is the assignment operater and allows us to assign a new value<br/>
    to a variable. Its very easy to make the common mistake of using the '=' <br/>
    assignment operater while testing a condition such as in a if( 5 = 3) <br/>
    .. if you do this your code will not compile!<br/><br/>
    The '==' is the equality operater. This operator is used to compare <br/>
    primitive types like integers. So if you use the '==' equality operater<br/>
    to compare two strings the result may not be correct. The reason for this <br/>
    is that a string is an 'object' and an object is a reference type.<br/>
    A reference type does not contain the data like a primitive type such <br/>
    as an integer so this is when you would use the string method '.equals'.<br/>
